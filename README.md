# NTierECommerceDB
A basic E-Commerce database is created (Code First). 
N-Tier and Singleton patterns are used through the process. 
CRUD operations on Category repository can be done on UI, which works on WFA.
All the custom methods can be seen in Project.BLL, some of them are not used on the UI.
